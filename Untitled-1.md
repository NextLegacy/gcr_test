Heyy Milo 👋!

I'm NextLegacy, and I'm here to bring some next-level software magic to your projects!
I specialize in turning any digital idea into reality, quickly, efficiently, and compromise free!

Here's my loadout:
-   Websites that are WOW: 🔥 I craft super optimized and animated websites that aren't just pretty, but also handle huge databases and high user traffic like! Check out some of my work:
    -   https://nextlegacy.de - My personal playground for trying new things.
    -   https://laify.de - A recent project.
    -   sadly, I can't share all projects here, but I am allowed to share some of my work with you in private! Just ask!
-   Complex Applications: ⚙️ Need a custom application built from scratch? I'm your guy! From concept to launch, I ensure smooth functionality and awesome user experience.
-   Adobe Plugins: ⚡️ Want to supercharge your editing workflow? I create custom Adobe plugins that will make your life SO much easier!
-   Turning the Impossible into Reality: 🤯 I once had the idea to play Destiny 2 on my calculator, the same day I shaterskated in Kingsfall on it! Yeah, I can do stuff like that! No idea is too crazy!

A bit about me: I'm 18 years old and in my first semester of a Computer Science B.Sc at RWTH Aachen University, and I've been coding since I was 10! I recently helped build a 3D game engine for education. I live and breathe freelance work and creating innovative solutions.
