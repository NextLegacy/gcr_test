Okay, I've focused on making the wording sound more natural, conversational, and less like it was written by an AI. Here's the revised response:

Hey Milo 👋!

It's NextLegacy, and I'm excited to potentially work together on your projects! I specialize in taking digital ideas and turning them into real, working things quickly, without cutting any corners.

Here's what I'm good at:

*   **Websites that are Actually Good:** 🔥 I build websites that are super smooth, look awesome, and can handle tons of traffic and databases without breaking a sweat. Here's some of my stuff:
    *   https://nextlegacy.de That's where I mess around and experiment with new stuff.
    *   https://laify.de A recent project where I made sure the website was easy to use and looked great.
    *   I can't show you *everything* I've worked on because some of it's private, but I can tell you more about it if you're interested!
*   **Custom Apps:** ⚙️ Need an app built from scratch? I'm your person. I can handle everything from start to finish and make sure it's easy to use and works perfectly.
*   **Adobe Plugins:** ⚡️ Want to make your editing workflow way faster and better? I can create custom plugins to do just that.
*   **Making Crazy Ideas Real:** 🤯 I once got Destiny 2 running on a calculator, and I'm not even kidding! That's the kind of stuff I like doing.

A bit about me: I'm 18 and studying Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University. I've been coding since I was 10, and I love creating new stuff. I recently helped build a 3D game engine for learning purposes.

**Summarise what you can contribute in 1 word or phrase. (eg "Dancer", "Carpenter", "Filming Location", "Free Raw Materials", "Registered Diving Instructor", "Voice Actor", "Attorney", "Can get David Beckham on the Phone", etc)***

Software Development

**Is payment required for your skill / contribution?***

Yes

**If yes (payment needed), what is the cost / rate / etc?**

I try to keep my prices reasonable. 🤝 It really depends on how complicated and big your project is. Let's talk about it, and I can give you a quote that works for you. 😊

**Optional: Do you have an idea for a project that you want to pitch? How can we collaborate to make your dream idea happen?**

I do! 🤩 Check these out:

*   **The Best Fan Website Ever:** 🎉 A website packed with easter eggs, behind-the-scenes stuff, and interactive things to keep the community happy!
*   **Better Editing Tools:** 🛠️ Your content is already great, so I'd love to build some plugins to make editing faster and better!

I have a ton of ideas and I'm always up for a challenge. Let's team up and make something amazing!

**Any other relevant info, please add here!**

I'm super excited about the chance to work on some cool projects! Feel free to ask me anything. Whether it's building a website, creating an app, or just coming up with crazy ideas, I'm ready to get started. As a student, I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn, and I appreciate your consideration! Looking forward to hearing from you!
